# MocapReader
This package implements code for reading .bvh and .htr motion capture file format.

This repository aims at packaging the code developed by Mike Meredith at University of Sheffield. The original code and associated paper is available [here](https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/S.Maddock/phd_theses/meredith/mocapfileformats.html)

In this package, we focused on creating a minimal library out of the original code for developers who simply want to read .bvh and .htr files. The OpenGL code to display the animation (Windows-specific) has been left out.
